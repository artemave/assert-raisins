# Assert-raisins

Minimalistic, debugger friendly test runner for Node.

Inspired by [baretest](https://github.com/volument/baretest)

## Features

- fast
- parallel
- run test for a line number
- no nesting
- better test cleanup (than after hooks)
- esm
- typescript types included

## Usage

Install:

    npm i --save-dev assert-raisins

Write a test `test/firstTest.js`:

```javascript
import { test } from 'assert-raisins'
import assert from 'node:assert'

test('first passing test', () => {
  assert.ok(true)
})

test('first failing test', async () => {
  assert.equal(1, 2)
})
```

Run all tests:

    ./node_modules/.bin/ars test/**/*Test.js

Run individual test:

    # by line number
    ./node_modules/.bin/ars test/someTest.js:123

Other things available:

- `it` which is an alias for `test`
- `beforeEach()` to run some code before each test in a file
- `beforeAll()` to run some code before all tests in a file

### Test cleanup

Use `cleanup` function to register some cleanup hook. If it happens to be called within `beforeAll`, it will be executed "after all". If it's called within `beforeEach`, it'll be run "after each", and if it's called within a test, it will be executed after that test. `cleanup` can be invoked multiple times.

In this example, the server will be stopped after each test:

```javascript
import { cleanup } from 'assert-raisins'

class Server {
  start() {
    ...
    cleanup(() => this.stop())
  }
}

beforeEach(async () => {
  const server = new Server()
  await server.start()
})
```

### Parallel tests

When more than one test file is run, the load is distributed between concurrent workers (limited by the number of CPU cores). Each workers is passed `TEST_WORKER_ID` environment variable (so you can, for instance, create that many test databases).

### typescript, jsx, sourcemaps, code coverage

Use `NODE_OPTIONS` environment variable for any of that. For example, for typescript:

```sh
NODE_OPTIONS="--enable-source-maps --loader ts-node/esm" ./node_modules/.bin/ars test/*.test.ts
```
